								<p>Hi everyone! My name's Radhika and I am a first year Industrial Engineering student at Georgia Tech. Growing up in the suburbs of Atlanta, I have always love the city and have dreamed of living here since I was little. I'm so glad that Georgia tech has given me that opportunity, and I can say that Tech and Atlanta have changed me for the better in so many ways. This past year, I’ve learned to prioritize on personal goals, learn what relationships are important to me, to take the big risks and go strive for opportunities. I’m so amazed of what I’ve learned about myself through these past two semesters and am extremely excited to see what these next three years have in store for me.</p>
								<p>Professionally, through my college career, I hope to get take internships in three different fields. First, I would like to get experience working in the Supply-Chain field, specifically on the consumer goods side. In America, there are several issues in how consumer goods, specifically with edible goods, are created and distributed. I would to be able to solve some of those issues, and make the process of manufacturing goods more efficient. Next, I would like to intern in a consulting firm. While I’m pretty confident I won’t want to work in consulting during my full time job, I want to get experience working in the field to get a sense of the work environment. Last, I want to intern in some sort of data analysis role. This is the field that is most interesting tome because I will be able to directly support companies by giving meaning to all the data they have. For me, seeing the direct benefits a company gains from my job is extremely important, and I think working with data analytics will allow me to see that best.
								</p>
								<p>On campus, last semester, I was involved with TEDx Georgia Tech as a brand ambassador. This semester, I am pledging Alpha Kappa Psi, a co-ed, professional business fraternity. While I’ve grown so much from these organizations, next semester, I would love to get involved with a service related organization. In high school, most of my extracurricular activities were service related, and those were also my most enjoyable activites. More than that, I just want to be able to give back to my community more than I have had the opportunity to do this semester.
								</p>
								<p>Besides all of that, I made this website to have an outlet for my writing! I really enjoy blog-style writing, and what better way to do it then to make your own website? Even though there are several third-party sights that I can blog on, I have been wanting to learn how to use HTML for some time, so blogging and making my own website seemed to work together perfectly. In the future, I hope to write more about my experiences; personal and professional.
								</p>
								<p>Thank you for visiting!
