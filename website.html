								<p>When I first decided I wanted to make my own blog, I was looking for the right medium to put my blog on. I knew there were several services that allowed you to create a website using their services, like Weebly or Wix. Another option was to use a website made for sharing stories, like Medium. But, the idea of being able make my own website and be as creative as I wanted was always enticing to me. I have also wanted to learn more about web design, and making my own website has allowed to learn and grow my skills in HTML. </p>
								<p>However, if you have little to no experience in HTML, you can still make your own website! I'll be going over the steps that I took to create my own website.
								</p>
								<p>I started off by making my custom domain. This is potentially just your website's name. I found mine from NameCheap to get my domain, and it costs me about $4 a year, but there are other websites, such as Google domains, where you can find several options.
								</p>
								<p>The next step is to create a GitHub account. (When I was first learning how to make my own website, I was confused about the use GitHub, but I have learned that I simply use it to "push" the code I write to my website.) Once you make your account, make a new repository, and add the custom domain you got earlier to it. You can do this by going under "Settings" inside your repository. Now, any code you add to your repository will be found with your custom domain name.
								</p>
								<p>Next, you need to download GitHub software onto your computer. This way, you put your HTML files into your GitHub file, and "push" out your code. When you get the software (which you can get from Googling "GitHub" software), you can look for an HTML template. Because I wanted my website to be more complex, I used an HTML template website, because it will allow me to not be restricted by only my knowledge of HTML. I used the website HTML5 UP. This website offers multiple HTML templates, and you can pick which one works best for you!
								</p>
								<p>After you choose the template you want, simply click "Download Template". When the file has downloaded, copy each element of the file and paste it into the GitHub folder you created when downloading the GitHub software. This, way you can commit and push changes you make in your code.
								</p>
								<p>After all this setting up, you can finally add your information! In any text editor (I suggest Atom), open your index.html file, and replace all the white words with your information. To actually see the change on your website, write a summary in the GitHub software, click "Commit" and then "Push". Now your website is updated with your information! Now just keep adding information, and then committing, and finally pushing the information onto your website.
								</p>
								<p>While this process to setting up your website is a little long, being able to build a website and to see the steps that go into it is amazing!!
